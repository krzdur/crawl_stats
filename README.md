# SC crawl stats scraper

---------------

A script built to scrape crawl statistics from Google Search Console interface.

## Installation
No istallation is required. As the solution is based on Selenium, downloading

## Context

Google Search Console is a tool used to monitor and optimize presence and
position of one's website in Google Search Engine.
One of the reports provides data on indexing performance (crawl stats).
The data was stored for last 90 days only. The script was built do make automatic
backups of this data.

**The interface of Search Console changed multiple times since then, hence, the
project has been discontinued.**
